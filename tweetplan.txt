old plans do not need:
Scrape a timeframe of tweets and make a graph of what times user tweets
Make a graph showing how many different people replied to each tweet depending on time of day?
wordcloud of tweets- generate an image.
Display outlier tweets- most replies/rts.
do the above but compare two objects- people or hashtags.
