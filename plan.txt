# COMSC-165-Project

Step by step:
- put location and time from each object into classes. Use template for content (can be string or binary)
    - twitter: include any self replies in both directions as objects to be scraped.
    - web jpegs: each picture should be a hotlink if possible.
    - local jpegs: each pic is stored as a file pointer and read into kmz file later.
    - text entry: launch option to either directly geotag the address, or to ask for browser confirmation first.
- each location object is put into a linked list in chronological order.
- and then appended to a kml file. the kml consists of a layer with two sublayers, one for the path and one for all the objects.
    - extra credit: add capability to append/merge with existing file's sublayers.
    - extra credit: add capability to extract pictures from kmz or hotlinked kml to local dir (fail gracefully for hotlinks).
