The program accepts input from a variety of sources, each containing a set of geotagged time-sensitive data (such as geotagged tweets, or jpeg images with exif tags for both time and location). The program then generates a kml file with a path object drawn in chronological order based on the data. The file also includes placemarks at each node, embedding the contents of each object (image or tweet text), as well as the time of creation. The program will use classes, pointers, files, linked lists, and templates.
